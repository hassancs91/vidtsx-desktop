WHISPER.CPP BINARY SETUP
========================

For local transcription to work, you need to download the whisper.cpp
Windows binary and place it in this directory.

DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:

2. Download the latest Windows release (e.g., whisper-bin-x64.zip)
3. Extract and copy "main.exe" to this folder

REQUIRED FILE:
- main.exe (the whisper.cpp CLI executable)

The models will be downloaded automatically when the user selects them
in the app. They are stored in the user's app data directory.

must download it manually for local development.
